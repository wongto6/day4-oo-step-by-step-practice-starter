O: Today, I learned about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, focusing on examples like animals and the relationships among students, teachers, and schools. We explored key principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, enhancing our understanding of how to model real-world scenarios.

R: The hands-on practice was engaging; creating classes for animals and educational roles allowed me to see the practical applications of OOP. I felt excited about the potential to simplify complex systems through these abstractions.

I: OOP can significantly improve code organization and reusability. The retrospective meeting emphasized the importance of collaboration and feedback in refining our understanding and practices, fostering a growth mindset within the team.

D: Moving forward, I plan to apply these OOP principles in future projects. I also aim to actively participate in retrospective meetings to contribute to continuous improvement and learning.
